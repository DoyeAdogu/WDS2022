                <p><strong class="h3">4</strong> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
                    made and baptized more disciples
                    than John,</p>

                <p>2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>

                <p>3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>

                <p>4 And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>

                <p>5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that
                    Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>

                <p>6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the
                    well:
                    and it was about the sixth hour.</p>

                <p>7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</p>

                <p>8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</p>

                <p>9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me,
                    which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>

                <p>10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to
                    thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
                    water.</p>

                <p>11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from
                    whence
                    then hast thou that living water?</p>

                <p>12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and
                    his children, and his cattle?</p>

                <p>13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>

                <p>14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water
                    that
                    I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>

                <p>15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to
                    draw.</p>

                <p>16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>

                <p>17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I
                    have
                    no husband:</p>

                <p>18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst
                    thou truly.</p>

                <p>19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>

                <p>20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men
                    ought to worship.</p>

                <p>21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this
                    mountain,
                    nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</p>

                <p>22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>

                <p>23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit
                    and
                    in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</p>

                <p>24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>

                <p>25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come,
                    he
                    will tell us all things.</p>

                <p>26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>

                <p>27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man
                    said,
                    What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</p>

                <p>28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</p>

                <p>29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</p>

                <p>30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>

                <p>31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</p>

                <p>32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</p>

                <p>33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</p>

                <p>34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
                </p>

                <p>35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift
                    up
                    your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>

                <p>36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that
                    soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>

                <p>37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</p>

                <p>38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered
                    into their labours.</p>

                <p>39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which
                    testified, He told me all that ever I did.</p>

                <p>40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them:
                    and
                    he abode there two days.</p>

                <p>41 And many more believed because of his own word;</p>

                <p>42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him
                    ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>

                <p>43 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>

                <p>44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>

                <p>45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things
                    that
                    he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>

                <p>46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a
                    certain
                    nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>

                <p>47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought
                    him
                    that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>

                <p>48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</p>

                <p>49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>

                <p>50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had
                    spoken unto him, and he went his way.</p>

                <p>51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</p>

                <p>52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at
                    the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>

                <p>53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son
                    liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>

                <p>54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
