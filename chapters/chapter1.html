                <p><strong class="h3">1</strong> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
                    Word
                    was
                    God.</p>

                <p>2 The same was in the beginning with God.</p>

                <p>3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
                </p>

                <p>4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>

                <p>5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>

                <p>6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p>

                <p>7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might
                    believe.
                </p>

                <p>8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</p>

                <p>9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>

                <p>10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</p>

                <p>11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</p>

                <p>12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them
                    that
                    believe
                    on his name:</p>

                <p>13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
                    God.
                </p>

                <p>14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the
                    only
                    begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>

                <p>15 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after
                    me
                    is
                    preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>

                <p>16 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</p>

                <p>17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>18 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,
                    he
                    hath
                    declared him.</p>

                <p>19 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
                    him,
                    Who
                    art
                    thou?</p>

                <p>20 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</p>

                <p>21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet?
                    And
                    he
                    answered, No.</p>

                <p>22 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What
                    sayest
                    thou
                    of thyself?
                </p>

                <p>23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as
                    said the
                    prophet Esaias.</p>

                <p>24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</p>

                <p>25 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ,
                    nor
                    Elias,
                    neither that prophet?</p>

                <p>26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye
                    know
                    not;</p>

                <p>27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to
                    unloose.</p>

                <p>28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>

                <p>29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh
                    away the
                    sin of the world.</p>

                <p>30 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was
                    before
                    me.</p>

                <p>31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come
                    baptizing
                    with
                    water.</p>

                <p>32 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it
                    abode
                    upon him.</p>

                <p>33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon
                    whom
                    thou
                    shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the
                    Holy
                    Ghost.</p>

                <p>34 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</p>

                <p>35 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</p>

                <p>36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</p>

                <p>37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</p>

                <p>38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto
                    him,
                    Rabbi,
                    (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</p>

                <p>39 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that
                    day:
                    for it
                    was about the tenth hour.</p>

                <p>40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
                </p>

                <p>41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which
                    is,
                    being
                    interpreted, the Christ.</p>

                <p>42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of
                    Jona:
                    thou
                    shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</p>

                <p>43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him,
                    Follow me.</p>

                <p>44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</p>

                <p>45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and
                    the
                    prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</p>

                <p>46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto
                    him,
                    Come
                    and see.</p>

                <p>47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
                    guile!</p>

                <p>48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before
                    that
                    Philip
                    called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</p>

                <p>49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of
                    Israel.</p>

                <p>50 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree,
                    believest
                    thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</p>

                <p>51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and
                    the
                    angels
                    of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>
