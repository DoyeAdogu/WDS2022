                <p><strong class="h3">9</strong> And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
                    birth.</p>

                <p>2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was
                    born blind?</p>

                <p> 3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God
                    should be
                    made manifest in him.</p>

                <p>4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can
                    work.</p>

                <p>5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>

                <p>6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed
                    the
                    eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>

                <p>7 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went
                    his
                    way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>

                <p>8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not
                    this
                    he that sat and begged?</p>

                <p>9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</p>

                <p>10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>

                <p>11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said
                    unto
                    me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>

                <p>12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>

                <p>13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>

                <p>14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>

                <p>15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He
                    put
                    clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</p>

                <p>16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the
                    sabbath
                    day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division
                    among
                    them.</p>

                <p>17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He
                    said, He is a prophet.</p>

                <p>18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight,
                    until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</p>

                <p>19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now
                    see?</p>

                <p>20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
                </p>

                <p>21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is
                    of
                    age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>

                <p>22 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already,
                    that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>

                <p>23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>

                <p>24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know
                    that this man is a sinner.</p>

                <p>25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that,
                    whereas I
                    was blind, now I see.</p>

                <p>26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>

                <p>27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it
                    again?
                    will ye also be his disciples?</p>

                <p>28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</p>

                <p>29 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</p>

                <p>30 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from
                    whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</p>

                <p>31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his
                    will, him he heareth.</p>

                <p>32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born
                    blind.</p>

                <p>33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>

                <p>34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?
                    And
                    they cast him out.</p>

                <p>35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou
                    believe on the Son of God?</p>

                <p>36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</p>

                <p>37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>

                <p>38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>

                <p>39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and
                    that they which see might be made blind.</p>

                <p>40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we
                    blind
                    also?</p>

                <p>41 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see;
                    therefore
                    your sin remaineth.</p>
