                <p><strong class="h3">10</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
                    into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>

                <p>2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>

                <p>3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name,
                    and leadeth them out.</p>

                <p>4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for
                    they know his voice.</p>

                <p>5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of
                    strangers.</p>

                <p>6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he
                    spake unto them.</p>

                <p>7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
                </p>

                <p>8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</p>

                <p>9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find
                    pasture.</p>

                <p>10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might
                    have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>

                <p>11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</p>

                <p>12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf
                    coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
                </p>

                <p>13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</p>

                <p>14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</p>

                <p>15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>

                <p>16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall
                    hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p>

                <p>17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</p>

                <p>18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have
                    power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>

                <p>19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</p>

                <p>20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</p>

                <p>21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of
                    the blind?</p>

                <p>22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</p>

                <p>23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</p>

                <p>24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If
                    thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>

                <p>25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name,
                    they bear witness of me.</p>

                <p>26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</p>

                <p>27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>

                <p>28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
                    them out of my hand.</p>

                <p>29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my
                    Father's hand.</p>

                <p>30 I and my Father are one.</p>

                <p>31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>

                <p>32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those
                    works do ye stone me?</p>

                <p>33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and
                    because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</p>

                <p>34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</p>

                <p>35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
                </p>

                <p>36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest;
                    because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>

                <p>37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>

                <p>38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that
                    the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>

                <p>39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</p>

                <p>40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he
                    abode.</p>

                <p>41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of
                    this man were true.</p>

                <p>42 And many believed on him there.</p>
