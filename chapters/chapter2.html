                <p><strong class="h3">2</strong> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
                    mother of Jesus was there:</p>

                <p>2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>

                <p>3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</p>

                <p>4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</p>

                <p>5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</p>

                <p>6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews,
                    containing two or three firkins apiece.</p>

                <p>7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p>

                <p>8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare
                    it.
                </p>

                <p>9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it
                    was:
                    (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
                </p>

                <p>10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have
                    well
                    drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>

                <p>11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and
                    his
                    disciples believed on him.</p>

                <p>12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples:
                    and they continued there not many days.</p>

                <p>13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>

                <p>14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money
                    sitting:</p>

                <p>15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the
                    sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</p>

                <p>16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an
                    house
                    of merchandise.</p>

                <p>17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
                </p>

                <p>18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou
                    doest
                    these things?</p>

                <p>19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
                </p>

                <p>20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up
                    in
                    three days?</p>

                <p>21 But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>

                <p>22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto
                    them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>

                <p>23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name,
                    when
                    they saw the miracles which he did.</p>

                <p>24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</p>

                <p>25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
